This directory contains preprocessing code that tracks the sentiment information of each word.
Eespecially, it computes the probability that a certain word describes some opinion, which is implemented in 
MaxEnt_Auto_Lableling.py file. Rest of the code is similar to what's in parent dictionary, but it is slightly
modified to keep track of metainformation required for sentiment extraction task. Code is not production ready
in any sense, it rather consist the core functionalities that I myself can just copy & paste as a part of more organized
codebases.
